# Architecture Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview of the Manus Backend architecture.

## System Architecture

The Manus Backend is designed with a modular architecture that allows for easy extension and maintenance. The system is composed of several key components:

### 1. API Layer

The API layer is built with FastAPI and provides RESTful endpoints for client applications to interact with the backend. It handles request validation, routing, and response formatting.

### 2. Provider Manager

The Provider Manager is the core component responsible for managing multiple AI providers. It:
- Maintains a registry of available providers
- Implements fallback strategies (priority-based, round-robin, random)
- Handles rate limiting and error recovery
- Routes requests to appropriate providers based on availability and configuration

### 3. Provider Implementations

Each AI provider has its own implementation that:
- Handles provider-specific API interactions
- Manages authentication and rate limits
- Formats requests and responses according to provider requirements
- Tracks usage statistics and error rates

### 4. Task Queue

The Task Queue handles background processing for long-running tasks. It:
- Manages asynchronous task execution
- Provides status tracking and progress reporting
- Implements retry logic for failed tasks
- Stores task results for later retrieval

### 5. Configuration System

The Configuration System manages application settings and provider configurations. It:
- Loads settings from YAML files
- Supports environment variable substitution
- Provides sensible defaults for missing values
- Validates configuration values

## Component Interactions

The following diagram illustrates how the components interact:

```

1. The client application sends a request to the API layer
2. The API layer validates the request and forwards it to the Provider Manager
3. The Provider Manager selects an appropriate provider based on the request and configuration
4. If the selected provider fails, the Provider Manager falls back to alternative providers
5. The response is returned to the client application

## Fallback Strategy

The fallback strategy is a key feature of the Manus Backend. It ensures that requests can be fulfilled even when some providers are unavailable or rate-limited. The system supports three fallback strategies:

1. **Priority-based**: Providers are tried in order of priority (lowest number first)
2. **Round-robin**: Providers are tried in a rotating sequence
3. **Random**: A random provider is selected for each request

When a provider fails or is rate-limited, the system automatically falls back to the next provider according to the selected strategy.

## Error Handling

The system implements comprehensive error handling:

1. **Provider-level errors**: Each provider implementation handles provider-specific errors and translates them into a common format
2. **Manager-level errors**: The Provider Manager handles fallback logic and retries
3. **API-level errors**: The API layer formats errors into consistent responses with appropriate HTTP status codes

## Scalability Considerations

The architecture is designed to scale in several dimensions:

1. **Provider scalability**: New providers can be added by implementing the Provider interface
2. **Request scalability**: The asynchronous design allows for efficient handling of concurrent requests
3. **Deployment scalability**: Docker containerization enables horizontal scaling

## Future Extensions

The architecture supports several potential extensions:

1. **Caching layer**: Add response caching to reduce provider API calls
2. **Authentication**: Implement API key or OAuth authentication
3. **Advanced routing**: Route requests to specific providers based on content or requirements
4. **Streaming responses**: Support streaming completions for real-time applications
5. **Monitoring and analytics**: Add detailed usage tracking and performance monitoring
